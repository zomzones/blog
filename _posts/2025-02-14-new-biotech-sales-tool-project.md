# Building the Future of Biotech Sales Insights

The biotech industry moves fast—and sales professionals need to stay ahead of the curve. That’s why I’m developing an AI-powered sales enablement tool, tentatively called **TouchPoints**, designed to provide personalized industry news, market insights, and actionable recommendations tailored to specific territories and customer lists. 

## Why This Project?
As someone who has worked in biotech sales, I understand the challenge of keeping up with rapidly evolving research, company news, and industry shifts while also managing client relationships. The goal of **TouchPoints** is to streamline this process, helping sales teams focus on what they do best: building meaningful connections and driving growth.

## What Will It Do?
- **Personalized News & Insights:** No more sifting through irrelevant headlines. The tool will curate the most relevant biotech news, press releases, and R&D updates specific to your sales territory or company list.
- **Competitive Intelligence:** Stay ahead of the competition with insights on product launches, clinical trial updates, and market shifts.
- **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Get actionable suggestions for outreach based on funding announcements, leadership changes, or other key industry movements.
- **Automated Reports & Alerts:** Customize how often you receive updates—whether through daily emails, weekly summaries, or real-time alerts.

## Who Is It For?
This tool is being built with biotech **sales reps, sales managers, and marketing teams** in mind—anyone who needs a constant pulse on industry movements to stay competitive and informed.

## How Am I Building It?
I’m leveraging AI-driven news aggregation, natural language processing (NLP), and intuitive dashboards to make this tool both powerful and easy to use. The initial phases focus on:
- **Validating Data Sources:** Aggregating news from reputable biotech feeds, financial reports, and research publications.
- **Building Prototypes:** Developing a working model for news summarization and company insights.
- **Iterating & Refining:** Testing the tool with real users to fine-tune features and improve accuracy.

## What’s Next?
Right now, I’m in the early stages of development, focusing on data ingestion and prototype testing. Over the next few months, I’ll be refining the AI summarization capabilities and building an interactive dashboard. 

I’ll be documenting my progress here—sharing insights, challenges, and lessons learned along the way. If you’re in biotech sales or interested in AI-driven business tools, I’d love to hear your thoughts!

Stay tuned for updates as I bring **TouchPoints** to life!
